## FACILITATOR HANDB OOK

VIRTUAL CAMPUS GUIDE


**YOU SHOULD STRUCTURE YOUR EVENT AS IF IT**

**WERE TAKING PLACE IN A PHYSICAL VENUE.**

**CONSIDER:**

- That it takes time for visitors to arrive and 'settle in'^
- That a 'receptionist' or 'welcome person' to greet new visitors helps ease them in^
- That it takes time to move between rooms^
- That some people may get lost, go to the wrong room, wander around, etc^

Much like in real life, there's nothing wrong with any of these cases - as long as there are
structures and facilitators in place to address them!


**IN THE SPIRIT OF A REAL-LIFE EVENT:**

- Think of activities to help visitors acclimatise & collaborate e.g. take sel **f** ies as a team^
- Change rooms a few times per hour, rather than just sitting in one spot (otherwise it's
    no di **ff** erent to a Zoom call)
- Have **_at least_** as many facilitators as you would in real life (perhaps have them wear a
    green hat to make them easily identi **f** iable)
- When designing the event think of how to transpose the real-life equivalent to the
    Virtual Campus - not the Zoom equivalent to the Virtual Campus
- Start o **ff** with everyone on a Zoom call (ideally using their phones) and ask them to
    launch the Virtual Campus on their laptops. If they have any issues at this point, this is
    their chance to **f** lag it over the Zoom call


**PRESENTING DOCUMENTS**

- You can not upload **f** iles to the Virtual Campus^
- The big screens around Campus are Shared Web
    Browsers - whatever is on those screens shows up for
    everyone else as well
- These screens can^
    - Share websites^
    - Share your webcam^
    - Share your desktop^
- If you would like to share content (PDF, PPT, etc) the
    ideal way is to either:
       - Share your desktop (much like in Zoom), or^
       - Share a **_public link_** to the PDF (e.g. by uploading
          your non-con **f** idential **f** ile to Google Slides and
          opening that in the Shared Browser - as seen in the
          adjacent screenshot)
