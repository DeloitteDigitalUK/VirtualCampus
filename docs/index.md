How much does it cost?

It costs nothing to come in and work on campus with groups of under 30 people. For more than 30 attendees we charge Â£20 per attendee for a fully supported event or event series (If you want to hold multiple sessions over the course of a month we only charge once). This is done on a similar basis to room bookings on the physical campus.
